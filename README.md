I'm a front-end engineer learned by myself after graduating from university.
Firstly working in Shanghai, and now move to Hangzhou.
I'd like to share knowledge about front-end and ideas in life with you.


This cute Jekyll theme called Ice bear forked from Song Kong.
To learn how to install and use this theme, please check out the [installation guide](http://kongsong.me/blog/ice-bear-jekyll-theme/) for more information.
